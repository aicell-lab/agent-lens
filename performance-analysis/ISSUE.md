# Performance Issue: Chunk Loading is Too Slow

Hi, currently I have an issue with performance of chunk loading. When accessing data, we have significant delays.

## What I Did
I created a performance test script to analyze the performance. The script tests two different approaches:

1. **Sequential loading**: Loads chunks one by one (current approach)
2. **Parallel loading**: Loads all chunks at the same time (proposed solution)

## Test Results
- **Sequential loading**: 6.0s for 10 chunks (1.7 chunks/sec)
- **Parallel loading**: 4.2s for 10 chunks (2.4 chunks/sec)

## Test Code
Feel free to check and run the script: [chunk_performance_analysis.js](https://github.com/aicell-lab/agent-lens/blob/8f7ac999d8f0fb5da5fb18acbb7dd49ad9d21e2b/performance-analysis/chunk_performance_analysis.js)

## Test Data
Here's an example zarr data: 'https://hypha.aicell.io/agent-lens/artifacts/20250824-example-data-20250824-221822/zip-files/well_C3_96.zip?path=data.zarr/'

## Script Output
```

```

## What This Means
The parallel approach is 1.4x faster than sequential loading. This shows that we can improve performance by loading chunks simultaneously instead of one by one.

## Next Steps
We should implement parallel loading in our chunk loading system to improve user experience.
