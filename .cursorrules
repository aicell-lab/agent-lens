## Common Patterns to Follow

### Service Registration Pattern
```python
async def setup_service(server, server_id="service-name"):
    # Service configuration and registration
    await server.register_service(service_config)
```

### React Component Pattern
```jsx
const ComponentName = ({ prop1, prop2, onCallback }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Setup and cleanup logic
    return () => {
      // Cleanup
    };
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  return <div>Component JSX</div>;
};

ComponentName.propTypes = {
  prop1: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  prop2: PropTypes.number,
  onCallback: PropTypes.func.isRequired
};
```

### Hardware Operation Pattern
```jsx
// Sample handling with proper state management and conflict prevention
const handleSampleOperation = async () => {
  if (currentOperation !== null || microscopeBusy) return;
  
  setCurrentOperation('loading'); // Prevent concurrent operations
  clearWorkflowMessages();
  
  try {
    addWorkflowMessage("Starting operation...");
    await validateHardwareState();
    await coordinateWithServices();
    addWorkflowMessage("Operation completed successfully");
    setCurrentOperation(null);
  } catch (error) {
    addWorkflowMessage(`Error: ${error.message}`);
    await rollbackOperation();
    setCurrentOperation(null);
  }
};
```

### Async Error Handling Pattern
```python
try:
    result = await some_async_operation()
    logger.info(f"Operation successful: {result}")
    return result
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
    raise
```

- Provide clear feedback on AI decision-making
- Implement safety checks for hardware control
- Support different operating modes (autofocus, cell finding, dataset creation)

## Time-Lapse Imaging Workflows
When implementing time-lapse functionality:
- Use the orchestrator service for task scheduling and execution
- Leverage local hypha-rpc setup for reliable device communication
- Implement proper time point generation and management
- Support well plate imaging zones with configurable FOV grids
- Handle illumination settings per channel with intensity/exposure control
- Coordinate between incubator sample handling and imaging schedules
- Provide real-time workflow progress feedback to users
