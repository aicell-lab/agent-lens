Agent-Lens: Smart Microscopy Web Application
============================================

Introduction
------------

Agent-Lens is a multimodal RAG-based smart microscopy web application designed to facilitate the capture, storage, and retrieval of microscopy images. Developed using React and TailwindCSS, this project leverages advanced web technologies to provide an intuitive and efficient user interface for microscopy image analysis.

Features
--------

-   **Image Capture**: Capture images using a simulated function that currently returns a placeholder image.
-   **Image Tagging and Storage**: Tag and store images temporarily in the browser for later retrieval.
-   **Image Search**: Search for similar images based on tags, with mock results displayed.

Technology Stack
----------------

-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
-   **Hypha-RPC**: Allows for remote procedure calls in web applications.
